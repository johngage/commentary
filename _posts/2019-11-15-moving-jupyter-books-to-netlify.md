  The process of moving Jupyter Books from GitHub to Netlify requires checking
  how they are published now.




  - It is a complicated situation, since some are on the Master branch, some are
  on the ch branch, some have different versions of software, particularly
  Ruby....




  But it should work.  Netlfy allows renaming URL's which is important now.
