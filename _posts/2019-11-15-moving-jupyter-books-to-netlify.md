  The process of moving Jupyter Books from GitHub to Netlify requires
  understanding how they are published now.


  * Master directory contains book subdirectories:
   ` ~/Repos/BookJupyter/`


  * Current list: 


  Directory | Static Site Builder | Status

  :--- | :---- | :----

  B2050 | jekyll JB | Github published

  BB ||

  berkeleyvision2050 | |

  dailycal | | 

  h1  | jekyll JB| published




  Some are on the Master branch, some are on the ch branch, some have different
  versions of software, particularly Ruby....


  But it should work.  Netlfy allows renaming URL's which is important now.
